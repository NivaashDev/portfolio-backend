# Portfolio Backend

Welcome to the **Portfolio Backend** repository! This project serves as the foundation for my personal portfolio website, where I will showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a full-stack developer.

## Overview

The purpose of this backend is to manage the data for my portfolio, including projects, descriptions, and links to my work. It provides the necessary functionality to handle information in a structured way, allowing me to easily update and maintain the content displayed on my portfolio website.

### Key Features

- **Project Management**: Easily add, update, and delete projects that I want to showcase.
- **API Integration**: The backend will provide a RESTful API that allows the frontend of my portfolio to fetch project data dynamically.
- **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to grow, allowing me to add new features in the future without major changes to the existing code.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For running JavaScript on the server.
- **Express.js**: A framework to simplify API development and routing.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database to store project details.
- **Mongoose**: A library to interact with MongoDB easily using schemas.
